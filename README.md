# Blackjack
Blackjack with a GUI to play.

To play, download the files and extract them to a location of your choice, then run the Blackjack.py file.
To get another card, press hit. 
To stay, press anywhere but the hit button.
To play again, you currently have to restart the file.

blackjackRevised.py is the same program, but I completely refactored it to make it much nicer looking. 

blackjack.py was written my first semester of college (fall 2018) and blackjackRevised.py was written my last semester of college (Spring 2021).
