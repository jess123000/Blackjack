# Blackjack
Blackjack with a GUI to play.

To play, download the files and extract them to a location of your choice, then run the Blackjack.py file.
To get another card, press hit. 
To stay, press anywhere but the hit button.
To play again, you currently have to restart the file. blackjackExtended.py was where I was attempting to make a play again button, but currently it does not work.
